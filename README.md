This C++ program implements the stack data structure using an array and performs the actions below:
- Push one by one all characters of any given string into the stack
- Pop one by one all characters from the stack and store them in the same string
- Output the string before and after popping

When the characters are pushed onto the stack and then popped back, the string is reversed. This demonstrates the LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature of the stack.
